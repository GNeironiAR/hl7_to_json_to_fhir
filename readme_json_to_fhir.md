# JSON to FHIR Converter for ORU Messages

## Overview

This script converts JSON representations of HL7 ORU (Observational Result Unsolicited) messages into FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It is specifically designed to work with JSON output generated by our previous HL7 to JSON conversion process, which only supports ORU messages.

## Key Features

- Converts JSON representation of ORU messages to FHIR Bundle resources
- Creates a DiagnosticReport resource with associated Observation resources
- Handles date and time conversions from HL7 format to FHIR format
- Generates unique IDs for each FHIR resource
- Logs detailed information about the conversion process

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `fhirclient` library installed
- Input JSON file named `output.json` in the same directory as the script

## How It Works

1. **JSON Parsing**: The script reads the `output.json` file, which contains the JSON representation of an HL7 ORU message.

2. **FHIR Resource Creation**:
   - Creates a FHIR Bundle of type "transaction"
   - Generates a DiagnosticReport resource
   - Creates multiple Observation resources based on OBX segments

3. **Date Handling**:
   - Parses HL7 dates from the JSON input
   - Converts dates to appropriate FHIR formats (FHIRDateTime for effectiveDateTime, FHIRInstant for issued)

4. **Reference Management**:
   - Creates references between the DiagnosticReport and Observation resources
   - Ensures all resources reference the correct patient

5. **Output Generation**:
   - Writes the resulting FHIR Bundle to `output_fhir.json`

## Key Controls and Validations

- **Input Validation**: Ensures the input JSON has the expected structure for ORU messages
- **Date Parsing**: Attempts to parse dates in multiple formats to handle variations in HL7 date representations
- **Resource Completeness**: Checks that all required fields for DiagnosticReport and Observation resources are present
- **Error Handling**: Logs errors and continues processing where possible, ensuring partial output in case of minor issues

## Limitations

- Only processes ORU (Observational Result Unsolicited) messages
- Expects a specific JSON structure as input, generated by our HL7 to JSON converter
- Does not handle all possible variations of HL7 messages or non-standard implementations
- Limited to creating DiagnosticReport and Observation resources

## Usage

1. Ensure `output.json` (generated from the HL7 to JSON conversion) is in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python json_to_fhir_converter.py
   ```
3. Check `output_fhir.json` for the resulting FHIR Bundle.
4. Review `fhir_conversion.log` for detailed logging information.

## Error Handling

- The script logs all activities and errors to `fhir_conversion.log`
- In case of critical errors, check the log file for detailed information
- The script attempts to continue processing even if parts of the conversion fail

## Customization

To adapt this script for other types of HL7 messages or different JSON structures:
1. Modify the `create_fhir_diagnostic_report` function to handle different input structures
2. Adjust date parsing in `parse_date` function if date formats differ
3. Add or modify resource creation logic as needed for different message types
